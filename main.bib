This paper presents a literature review of image hashing for image authentication in the last decade. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey and to highlight the pros and cons of existing state-of-the-art techniques. In this article, the general structure and classifications of image hashing based tamper detection techniques with their properties are exploited. Furthermore, the evaluation datasets and different performance metrics are also discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations and good practices drawn from the reviewed techniques.}

abstract = {The Photo Response Non-Uniformity is a unique sensor noise pattern that is present in each image or video acquired with a digital camera. In this work a wavelet-based technique used to extract these patterns from digital images is applied to compressed low resolution videos originating mainly from webcams. After recording these videos with a variety of codec and resolution settings, the videos were uploaded to YouTube, a popular internet video sharing website. By comparing the average pattern extracted from these resulting downloaded videos with the average pattern obtained from multiple reference cameras of the same brand and type, it was attempted to identify the source camera. This may be of interest in cases of child abuse or child pornography. Depending on the codec, quality settings and recording resolution, very satisfactory results were obtained.}

abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

abstract = {The prevalence of deep learning has drawn attention to the privacy protection of sensitive data. Various privacy threats have been presented, where an adversary can steal model owners' private data. Meanwhile, countermeasures have also been introduced to achieve privacy-preserving deep learning. However, most studies only focused on data privacy during training, and ignored privacy during inference.In this paper, we devise a new set of attacks to compromise the inference data privacy in collaborative deep learning systems. Specifically, when a deep neural network and the corresponding inference task are split and distributed to different participants, one malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into this system, even if he has no access to other participants' data or computations, or to prediction APIs to query this system. We evaluate our attacks under different settings, models and datasets, to show their effectiveness and generalization. We also study the characteristics of deep learning models that make them susceptible to such inference privacy threats. This provides insights and guidelines to develop more privacy-preserving collaborative systems and algorithms.},

One shortcoming of ANNs is their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations‚Äîsubtle modulations of natural images that result in changes to classification decisions, such as confidently mislabelling an image of an elephant, initially classified correctly, as a clock. In contrast, a human observer might well dismiss the perturbations as an innocuous imaging artifact. This phenomenon may point to a fundamental difference between human and machine perception, but it drives one to ask whether human sensitivity to adversarial perturbations might be revealed with appropriate behavioral measures. Here, we find that adversarial perturbations that fool ANNs similarly bias human choice. We further show that the effect is more likely driven by higher-order statistics of natural images to which both humans and ANNs are sensitive, rather than by the detailed architecture of the ANN.}

abstract = {The feld of defense strategies against adversarial attacks has signifcantly grown over the last years, but progress is hampered as the evaluation of adversarial defenses is often insuffcient and thus gives a wrong impression of robustness. Many promising defenses could be broken later on, making it diffcult to identify the state-of-the-art. Frequent pitfalls in the evaluation are improper tuning of hyperparameters of the attacks, gradient obfuscation or masking. In this paper we first propose two extensions of the PGD-attack overcoming failures due to suboptimal step size and problems of the objective function. We then combine our novel attacks with two complementary existing ones to form a parameter-free, computationally affordable and user-independent ensemble of attacks to test adversarial robustness. We apply our ensemble to over 50 models from papers published at recent top machine learning and computer vision venues. In all except one of the cases we achieve lower robust test accuracy than reported in these papers, often by more than 10\%, identifying several broken defenses.},
